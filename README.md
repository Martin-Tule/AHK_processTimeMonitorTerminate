  *Time limit for Steam is a must!!!*  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/64cnva/time_limit_for_steam_is_a_must/
  
The script demands that the following environment is supplied:
- AutoHotKey is installed (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- Windows Operative System
<br/>
  
The script supplies the following functionality:
- V1.1 - terminates one given process based on used time.
- V1.2 - adds termination based on computer time

  
This is a personal project made with the motivation based on the fun of coding itself. Suggestions of improvement of the source-code are very welcome and appreciated.
