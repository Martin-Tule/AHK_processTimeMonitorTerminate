# AHK_processTimeMonitorTerminate
An AutoHotKey script to monitor and based on user time values, terminate said processes.  
<br/>Based on user requests such as found on the listed sites below, proving that the functionality hereby intently provided is demanded by several people within the Windows user community:

  *Time limit for Steam is a must!!!*  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/64cnva/time_limit_for_steam_is_a_must/
  
The script demands that the following environment is supplied:
- AutoHotKey is installed (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- Windows Operative System
  
  
The script supplies the following functionality:
- V1.1 - terminates one given process based on used time.
- V1.2 - adds termination based on computer time
- V2.0 - adds watch for multiple programs
- V3.0 - catch user input upon process start
- V4.0 - add security features for user input (injection etc.)
  
This is a personal project made with the motivation based on the fun of coding itself. Suggestions of improvement of the source-code are very welcome and appreciated.
